# Amazona - eCommerce Website Project

![Amazona Homepage Display](/amazona/resources/Amazona Homepage.png?raw=true "Amazona Homepage")

This is a project to learn Node.js, React, MongoDB and Redux.
Amazona is an eCommerce website done with the guidance of Basir's course, found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRCDsB9i3bI&t=27679s.

On this website I practices the creation of a React app with a Node.js server, as well as a MongoDB database.
The project was fully built in guidance of the course tutorial. I created a server, frontend and DB for a fully functioning website with a registration system. The course had some outdated functions and methods, which I managed to overcome through research and fixes.
